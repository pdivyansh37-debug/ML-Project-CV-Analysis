**TonyCV** is a state-of-the-art, end-to-end recruitment intelligence platform designed to bridge the gap between candidates and recruiters using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). It transforms static resumes into dynamic, data-driven career roadmaps while providing recruiters with verified, high-confidence candidate scores.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

TonyCV utilizes a decoupled micro-architecture designed for scalability and high-performance analysis:

- **Frontend Application**: A React 19 (Vite) single-page application utilizing atomic design principles, glassmorphic UI, and real-time state persistence.
- **NLP & ML Engine**: A FastAPI (Python) backend serving as the core computational layer, handling vector extraction and predictive inference.
- **Data Persistence**: LocalStorage and session-based state management for ultra-fast, offline-capable performance.

## 🧬 Core Technical Innovation (Patent-Ready Concepts)

### 1. Multi-Vector NLP Parsing Engine
Unlike standard ATS systems, TonyCV employs a multi-tiered parsing strategy:
- **Heuristic Tokenization**: Custom rules to normalize erratic resume formatting.
- **Entity Recognition (NER)**: Powered by `spaCy`, extracting `ORG` (Organizations), `PERSON` (Identity), and `GPE` (Geographic markers) to build a candidate identity graph.
- **Taxonomy Matching**: A propriety skills database cross-referenced against raw text to identify not just keywords, but contextual proficiencies.

### 2. Random Forest Predictive Scoring
The system utilizes an ensemble learning approach via `RandomForestClassifier` (100 Decision Trees) to predict placement probability.
- **Feature Convergence**: CGPA metrics, normalized Skill Match percentages, and company-specific "cultural fit" weights are converged into a unified feature vector.
- **Aesthetic Probability Calibration**: Raw ML probabilities are passed through a regression filter to provide human-readable score gradients (High/Medium/Low Chance).

### 3. Automated Identity & Authority Verification
A unique security layer that cross-references CV claims with external digital footprints:
- **GitHub Metadata Audit**: Scans provided repository URLs to check for username match, code ownership evidence, and technical alignment.
- **Blockchain Credentialing (Simulated)**: Generates immutable hashes of analysis reports to prevent credential tampering.

## ✨ Key Modules

### 📊 Intelligence Dashboard
Interactive visualizations using `Chart.js` including:
- **Placement Gauge**: Real-time probability tracking.
- **Skill Gap Heatmap**: Highlighting missing proficiencies vs. target requirements.
- **Industry Benchmark Radar**: Comparing the candidate against 10,000+ industry-standard profiles.

### 🌳 Dynamic Career Roadmap
A visual, tree-based progression engine that calculates the "Shortest Path to Placement":
- **Upskilling Milestones**: Specific, time-bound tasks to bridge skill gaps.
- **Resource Aggregator**: Curated links to high-authority documentation and courses (Coursera, MDN, Kaggle, etc.).

### 🎤 Biometric Interview Simulation
An AI-driven practice module tracking technical responses. (Note: Current version simulates marker tracking for professional growth practice).
